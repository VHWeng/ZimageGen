αἴρω τήν ,greek man lifting round rock,"A bronze-skinned Greek man in a simple white chiton, hem damp with sweat, stands on a craggy Aegean cliff at dawn. He strains to lift a perfect, polished sphere of marble—its diameter equal to his torso—above his head, forearms etched with veins, toes gripping the weathered limestone. Behind him, the rising sun breaches the horizon, gilding the rock’s veining into ribbons of rose and gold while long shadows carve every muscle into heroic relief. The sea below mirrors the sky’s gradient from indigo to molten orange, and a single trireme glides in the distance, its sail catching the first light. Shot from a low, heroic angle with a 35 mm lens, f/1.8, the scene is rendered in high-resolution classical-realist style: sharp micro-detail on skin pores and stone grit, subtle film-grain warmth, color palette of ochre, azure, and burnished bronze. Cinematic rim-lighting outlines the figure, lens-flare halos the marble sphere, and a gentle volumetric mist softens the background, evoking mythic awe. Mood: triumphant yet precarious, as if the next heartbeat could send the world rolling into the sea.",αἴρω_τήν_0001
διώκω σε ,,"Cinematic chase scene at midnight on a rain-slick Athenian alley: a cloaked figure sprints toward camera, torchlight bouncing off wet cobblestones, crimson cloth fluttering, ancient pottery shards flying, shallow depth-of-field, teal-orange grade, high-contrast volumetric lighting, puddle reflections, motion blur on background, 35 mm film grain, tense thriller atmosphere, ultra-sharp 4-K photorealism.",διώκω_σε_0002

εἰμί ,John 8:12 — “I am the light of the world”,"A colossal translucent Christ-figure, carved from living sunlight, stands ankle-deep in a mirror-still cobalt sea that reflects both dawn and cosmos; His outstretched palms release spirals of liquid gold photons which cascade outward like ripples, turning every wave crest into molten glass. Behind Him, the horizon dissolves into a cathedral of clouds back-lit by a hidden sunrise—rose, amethyst, and vermilion shafts pierce the vapor, forming an implicit nimbus. The sky above transitions from warm terra-cotta at the horizon to a deep Prussian blue sprinkled with faint galaxies, suggesting timelessness. Shot from a low, slightly wide-angle viewpoint at water level so the viewer feels immersed, looking up in reverence; the figure occupies the lower two-thirds, leaving negative space for the light storm to expand. Hyper-realistic style, 8K clarity, subsurface scattering on skin made of light, micro-contrast fabric folds rendered as soft flares, bokeh sparkles on droplets. Cinematic lighting: key is the self-radiant figure (intensity 1.8, 4800 K), rim-lighted by sunrise kicker, fill provided by reflective sea at –2 EV, maintaining rich shadows. Mood: awe, invitation, quiet power. Color palette: warm golds, cool ultramarines, restrained highlights to avoid blow-out. Technical: 35 mm virtual lens, f/1.4 for shallow depth, ISO 64, shutter 1/125 s to freeze glimmering particles, subtle chromatic aberration for dreaminess, no text, no borders.",εἰμί_0004
ἡ ἀρχή ,the begeing of creation,"Ultra-wide 6K render, epic mythic realism: an endless obsidian void fractures open like cracked glass, releasing a single blinding sphere of pure white-gold light that spirals outward, birthing iridescent nebulae and embryonic galaxies. Foreground: a colossal, translucent hand—skin laced with glowing cyan constellations—cradles the newborn orb, fingertips dripping liquid starlight that crystallizes into floating runes of classical Greek marble. Mid-ground: concentric rings of color—deep Tyrian purple, electric vermilion, and auroral teal—ripple across the void, each band etched with faint φ-φ-φ golden ratio grids. Background: faint silhouettes of primordial titans fade into the darkness, their edges rim-lit by the infant universe. Lighting: dramatic chiaroscuro, key light from the central orb casting 8000K white rays that fracture into prismatic flares, volumetric god-rays through cosmic dust, subtle cool rim light (12000K) outlining the hand. Mood: sacred, breath-held genesis; silence before first sound. Palette: high-contrast warm highlights against cool desaturated shadows, accent pops of iridescent spectrum. Style: fusion of classical sculpture detail with hyper-real space photography, 32-bit color depth, f/1.4 bokeh on drifting stardust, sharp 200mm macro focus on runes, soft tilt-shift falloff toward edges. Shot on virtual Hasselblad, square format, subtle film grain, no text, no borders.",ἡ_ἀρχή_0005
ἡ δικαιοσύνη ,,"High-key courtroom fresco: blindfolded goddess Themis holding balanced golden scales that glow against soft ivory light, white marble pillars fading into mist, translucent drapery catching pastel highlights, subtle iridescent halo, wide symmetrical composition, soft diffused illumination, serene justice, ultra-realistic 8-K, Botticelli color harmony, tranquil yet authoritative atmosphere.",ἡ_δικαιοσύνη_0006
